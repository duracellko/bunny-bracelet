## Is the program name inspired by the famous scene from IT Crowd?

Yes, it totally is. And you can have my Bunny Bracelet.

I was thinking about the name for quite some time. One of the options I was considering was an alternative word for _rabbit_. Then _bunny_ came on my mind. And I started to laugh, because I started to think of _bunny bracelet_ scene from [IT Crowd](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487831/). Ands so **Bunny Bracelet** it was.
